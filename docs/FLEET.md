# Agent Fleet

Agent Fleet is the local-first control plane for durable multi-worker runs. It
is **not** a separate execution engine: a fleet worker is a headless
`codewhale exec` run that the fleet launches and tracks durably. See
[AGENT_RUNTIME.md](AGENT_RUNTIME.md) for how sub-agents, `exec`, and the fleet
converge on one durable runtime. In product language, a user may still "open a
sub-agent"; in architecture language, durable nested work should be a
fleet-backed worker with a role.

Use Fleet rather than short-lived `agent` fanout whenever the work
needs retry, sleep/restart survival, remote execution, receipts, or a ledgered
audit trail. The initial CLI surface is:

```sh
codewhale fleet init
codewhale fleet run tasks.json --max-workers 4
codewhale fleet status
codewhale fleet inspect <worker-id>
codewhale fleet logs <worker-id>
codewhale fleet artifacts <worker-id>
codewhale fleet interrupt <worker-id>
codewhale fleet restart <worker-id>
codewhale fleet resume <run-id>
codewhale fleet stop --all
```

`codewhale fleet resume <run-id>` is the restart-recovery verb: it replays the
ledger, reconciles any in-flight lease whose worker stopped heartbeating
(retrying within the task's budget, else failing and escalating per the alert
policy), and prints the post-resume status. It launches no new work and is
idempotent, so it is safe to run after a manager exit, laptop sleep, or runtime
restart.

Fleet state is stored under the workspace in `.codewhale/fleet.jsonl`. Worker
logs and adapter logs are stored under `.codewhale/fleet/` and
`.codewhale/fleet-host/`.

## Naming: Modes, WhaleFlow, Fleet, and Swarm

These names describe different layers, not competing systems. Agent, Plan, and
YOLO stay the permission/work modes. WhaleFlow is an orchestration overlay that
can run on top of those modes when the task needs a continuous workflow.

- **WhaleFlow** is the repeatable workflow plan and user-facing orchestration
  overlay: a script/IR that decides which phases and agents run next, keeps
  intermediate results out of the main conversation, and can be inspected or
  rerun. A WhaleFlow run should have a visible progress view and a clear active
  header state instead of feeling like a hidden background task.
- **Fleet** is the execution substrate: headless workers, local/SSH hosts,
  trust policy, leases, heartbeats, logs, receipts, and status APIs.
- **Swarm** is the high-fanout behavior inside WhaleFlow. It is gated in
  v0.8.61: `/swarm` must not revive prompt-only sub-agent fanout. It should
  compile into a WhaleFlow-backed fleet run once the durable worker and goal
  re-dispatch substrate is available.

UI guidance: keep the main transcript calm. A WhaleFlow run should appear as a
compact progress card plus Work/Agents sidebar rows with phase names, worker
counts, receipts, and nested indentation for child workers. Use the whale mark
sparingly as an active header/status signal; avoid repeating emoji-heavy rows
for every worker.

## Task Spec

`codewhale fleet run` accepts JSON or TOML. A minimal JSON spec:

```json
{
  "name": "local smoke",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "lint",
      "name": "Lint",
      "instructions": "Run the lint check and report failures.",
      "expected_artifacts": ["log"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Workers are optional. If omitted, CodeWhale creates local worker slots up to
`--max-workers`.

Task specs are typed in Rust and keep verification data separate from worker
transcripts. A task can declare:

- `id`, `name`, `description`, `objective`, and `instructions`
- `worker` role, tool profile, tools, and required capabilities
- `workspace` root, required files, writable paths, and environment allowlist
- `input_files`, extra `context`, `budget`, `timeout_seconds`, and `retry_policy`
- `expected_artifacts`, `scorer`, `tags`, and free-form `metadata`

Workers write bounded artifact files under `.codewhale/fleet/` and ledger only
the artifact refs: kind, path, checksum, MIME type, and size. Receipts record
`pass`, `fail`, `partial`, `skip`, or `timeout`; failed receipts may also mark
the source as `transport`, `task`, or `verifier`. `codewhale fleet status`
surfaces those failure-source counts separately.

Deterministic built-in scorers are `exit_code`, `file_exists`, `regex_match`,
and `json_path`. Specs may also declare `command`,
`code_whale_verifier_prompt`, or `manual`; those record a partial receipt until
an explicit verifier pass completes.

### Using Role Presets

Tasks can reference a role name, and the fleet manager fills in defaults
from the role registry. Built-in roles (`smoke-runner`, `reviewer`, `builder`,
`read-only`) are always available; define your own in `[fleet.roles]`.

```json
{
  "name": "smoke check",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "lint",
      "name": "Lint check",
      "instructions": "Run lint and report failures.",
      "worker": { "role": "smoke-runner" },
      "expected_artifacts": ["log"]
    }
  ]
}
```

The task inherits the role's tool profile, budget, and timeout. You can
override any field in the task spec:

```json
{
  "id": "deep-review",
  "name": "Deep review",
  "instructions": "Review the entire crate for soundness issues.",
  "worker": {
    "role": "reviewer",
    "tools": ["cargo", "rg", "git"],
    "capabilities": ["rust"]
  },
  "input_files": ["crates/**/*.rs"],
  "budget": { "max_tokens": 32000 },
  "expected_artifacts": ["log", "report"],
  "scorer": { "kind": "regex_match", "path": ".codewhale/fleet/report.md", "pattern": "finding|all clear" }
}
```

### Multi-Task Run Example

A single fleet run can dispatch several independent tasks in parallel:

```json
{
  "name": "CI gate",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "check",
      "name": "Compile check",
      "instructions": "Run cargo check --workspace and report errors.",
      "worker": { "role": "builder" },
      "expected_artifacts": ["log"],
      "scorer": { "kind": "exit_code" }
    },
    {
      "id": "clippy",
      "name": "Clippy lint",
      "instructions": "Run cargo clippy --workspace and report warnings.",
      "worker": { "role": "reviewer", "tools": ["cargo", "cargo-clippy"] },
      "expected_artifacts": ["log"],
      "scorer": { "kind": "exit_code" }
    },
    {
      "id": "security",
      "name": "Secret audit",
      "instructions": "Search for plaintext secrets and report any matches.",
      "worker": { "role": "read-only", "tools": ["rg"] },
      "input_files": ["crates/**/*.rs"],
      "expected_artifacts": ["log", "report"],
      "retry_policy": { "max_attempts": 1 }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Alerts

Fleet alerting is disabled by default. A caller must supply an enabled alert
config before anything is sent. Routes match typed fleet event classes, not log
strings:

- `stale`
- `restart_exhausted`
- `needs_human`
- `budget_exceeded`
- `verifier_failed`
- `run_completed`

Adapter config stores environment variable names, not secret values. Send-time
code resolves those names from the environment or a future secrets provider.
Ledger records store only audit labels such as `slack`, `webhook`, or
`pagerduty`; task specs persisted in the ledger redact webhook URLs and routing
keys.

Example alert config shape:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "dry_run": true,
  "routes": [
    {
      "events": ["stale", "restart_exhausted", "verifier_failed"],
      "adapter": "ops-slack"
    },
    {
      "events": ["restart_exhausted"],
      "adapter": "pager"
    }
  ],
  "adapters": {
    "ops-slack": {
      "kind": "slack",
      "webhook_env": "CODEWHALE_FLEET_SLACK_WEBHOOK",
      "channel": "#codewhale-fleet"
    },
    "pager": {
      "kind": "pager_duty",
      "routing_key_env": "CODEWHALE_FLEET_PAGERDUTY_ROUTING_KEY",
      "severity": "critical"
    }
  }
}
```

Use dry-run to inspect a redacted adapter payload without sending:

```sh
codewhale fleet alert-dry-run \
  --event stale \
  --run-id fleet-demo \
  --worker-id fleet-demo-local-1 \
  --task-id release-triage \
  --reason "worker heartbeat stale since 2026-06-13T02:00:00Z" \
  --adapter slack
```

The payload includes the run id, worker id, task id, status, short reason, and
safe inspection commands such as `codewhale fleet status` and
`codewhale fleet inspect <worker-id>`. Endpoints, webhook secrets, and
PagerDuty routing keys are shown as `<redacted:env:...>`.

## Status Surfaces

`codewhale fleet status` shows compact counts for queued, running, completed,
partial, failed, restarted, escalated, cancelled, stale, and verifier/transport
failure sources. `inspect` shows the worker state plus the current task
objective, role, host, heartbeat, latest event, artifact refs, latest error, and
alert state. `logs` prints bounded log artifact contents, and `artifacts` lists
artifact refs without embedding large payloads.

The Runtime API exposes the same ledger-backed projection behind the existing
runtime auth middleware:

```text
GET  /v1/fleet/runs
GET  /v1/fleet/runs/{run_id}
GET  /v1/fleet/runs/{run_id}/workers
GET  /v1/fleet/workers/{worker_id}
POST /v1/fleet/workers/{worker_id}/interrupt
POST /v1/fleet/workers/{worker_id}/restart
POST /v1/fleet/runs/{run_id}/stop
```

Action endpoints call the same manager controls as the CLI and record their
decisions in the fleet ledger.

## Manager-Agent Runbook

Manager agents should treat Fleet operations as typed, ledgered control-plane
work. Start with `codewhale fleet status`, then inspect one run or worker with
`codewhale fleet inspect <worker-id>`, `logs`, and `artifacts`. Use direct
reads of `.codewhale/fleet.jsonl`, host logs, or remote files only when the
typed CLI/API surface cannot provide the required evidence.

Classify the worker before taking action:

- `transient failure`: stale heartbeat, host timeout, interrupted transport,
  retryable provider/network error, or an adapter status that can plausibly
  recover without changing the task.
- `task failure`: the worker completed but produced an incorrect result,
  domain failure, missing required artifact, or explicit task-level error.
- `verifier failure`: the worker result exists, but the scorer/verifier failed,
  timed out, or disagrees with the receipt.
- `needs-human`: missing authority, secret request, destructive operation,
  repeated restart exhaustion, ambiguous product decision, or conflicting
  evidence that the manager cannot resolve from typed artifacts.

Choose one typed action:

- Restart a worker only when the failure is transient, retry budget remains,
  the task is idempotent or retry-safe, and no permission or secret boundary is
  involved: `codewhale fleet restart <worker-id>`.
- Interrupt or stop only when the current task is unsafe to continue or the
  operator explicitly asks for cancellation: `codewhale fleet interrupt
  <worker-id>` or `codewhale fleet stop --all`.
- Do not restart pure task failures by default; preserve artifacts and hand the
  receipt to the task owner unless the task spec says retrying can produce new
  evidence.
- For verifier failures, inspect scorer inputs and artifact refs first. If the
  verifier cannot be corrected through typed fleet actions, escalate for human
  review.
- For `needs-human`, draft an escalation instead of sending it unless alert
  config explicitly authorizes sending.

Safe Slack or PagerDuty draft:

```text
CodeWhale fleet needs attention
Run: <run-id>
Worker: <worker-id>
Task: <task-id or unknown>
Classification: <transient failure | task failure | verifier failure | needs-human>
Reason: <one sentence, no secrets>
Latest typed evidence: codewhale fleet inspect <worker-id>; codewhale fleet artifacts <worker-id>
Safe log excerpt: <3 lines max or "see artifact <ref>">
Requested decision: <restart approval | verifier review | task owner review | permission decision>
```

Post-run summaries should include the run id, workers checked, classification,
typed action taken or drafted, expected ledger effect, artifact refs reviewed,
and next owner. Keep summaries bounded; link artifact refs instead of copying
full logs or transcripts.

The bundled `fleet-manager` skill mirrors this runbook for manager agents. It
is a first-party system skill and should be discoverable through the normal
skill registry after system skills are installed or refreshed.

## Host Adapters

The host adapter boundary supports local child processes and explicit SSH
workers. Adapters expose the same operations: start, read status, read bounded
logs, interrupt, restart, stop, and cleanup.

Local workers run as child processes with stdin closed and stdout/stderr written
to bounded fleet host logs. They inherit only a small safe base environment
such as `PATH` and explicitly allowlisted variables.

SSH workers run through the system `ssh` client with `BatchMode=yes` and a
bounded connect timeout. Remote environment variables are sent with OpenSSH
`SendEnv`; values are not embedded in the local ssh argv or fleet logs.

Example SSH worker spec:

```json
{
  "id": "builder-1",
  "name": "Builder 1",
  "host": {
    "kind": "ssh",
    "host": "builder.example.com",
    "user": "codewhale",
    "port": 22,
    "identity": "~/.ssh/codewhale_fleet",
    "working_directory": "/srv/codewhale/work",
    "env_allowlist": ["CODEWHALE_PROFILE"],
    "codewhale_binary": "/usr/local/bin/codewhale"
  },
  "capabilities": ["local", "linux", "tests"],
  "max_concurrent_tasks": 1
}
```

Defaults are intentionally conservative:

- no hosted control plane or cloud provisioning is enabled;
- SSH requires an explicit host, working directory, and CodeWhale binary path;
- secret-like environment names such as `TOKEN`, `SECRET`, `PASSWORD`,
  `API_KEY`, and `PRIVATE_KEY` are rejected from adapter allowlists;
- secrets should remain in CodeWhale config providers or remote host config,
  not in task instructions, argv, or fleet logs.

## Security and Trust Boundaries

Agent Fleet enforces a trust-level model that separates workers into four tiers.
The trust level determines what a worker can access (secrets, network, workspace
writes) and how it must prove its identity before being granted those privileges.

### Trust Levels

| Level | Access | Requires |
|-------|--------|----------|
| `sandbox` | No network, no secrets, writes only to `.codewhale/fleet/` | Nothing — default for new workers |
| `local` | Workspace reads, gated writes, configured secrets | Local process (same uid) |
| `remote-verified` | Network access, bounded capability grants, configured secrets | SSH host-key verification or equivalent attestation |
| `operator` | Full access to all secrets, unrestricted writes, any action | Operator-owned machine |

The default trust level is `sandbox`. Operators must explicitly raise trust for
SSH or container workers through the security policy.

### Security Policy

A fleet run may carry an optional `security_policy` block that defines the
default trust level, which secrets workers may resolve, what capabilities are
granted, and a ceiling on the maximum trust level:

```json
{
  "security_policy": {
    "default_trust_level": "sandbox",
    "allowed_secrets": [
      {"key": "GH_TOKEN", "source": "env"},
      {"key": "CODEWHALE_API_KEY", "source": "keyring"}
    ],
    "capability_grants": [
      {
        "capability": "network",
        "scope": "github.com",
        "reason": "PR review needs GitHub API access"
      }
    ],
    "max_trust_level": "remote_verified",
    "require_identity_verification": true
  }
}
```

When a run has no explicit `security_policy`, workers inherit conservative
defaults: `sandbox` trust, no secrets, no capability grants, and no identity
verification requirement.

### Secret References

Secrets are never stored as plaintext in task specs, alert configs, or worker
definitions. Instead, every secret is a `FleetSecretRef` — a key name plus an
optional source hint that tells the fleet manager where to resolve the value:

```json
{"key": "GH_TOKEN", "source": "env"}
```

Supported sources:
- `"env"` — resolve from a process environment variable
- `"keyring"` — resolve from the OS keyring (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service)
- `"file"` — resolve from `~/.codewhale/secrets/`
- absent — try all sources in default order (store first, then env)

Secret refs are redacted in logs and ledger entries: `<secret:env.GH_TOKEN>`.

### Worker Authentication

Workers authenticate to the fleet manager using one of three methods:

- **None** — local workers sharing the same uid (default)
- **SSH key** — with optional host-key fingerprint pinning and known-hosts
  verification. The `host_key_fingerprint` field (SHA256:...) pins the expected
  server key, preventing MITM attacks on first connection.
- **Token** — a bearer token resolved from a `FleetSecretRef`, useful for remote
  workers behind a fleet proxy.
- **mTLS** — mutual TLS with a client certificate and a secret-backed private key.

SSH workers should always set `host_key_fingerprint` in production:

```json
{
  "id": "builder-1",
  "name": "Builder 1",
  "trust_level": "remote_verified",
  "host": {
    "kind": "ssh",
    "host": "builder.example.com",
    "user": "codewhale",
    "port": 22,
    "identity": "~/.ssh/codewhale_fleet",
    "host_key_fingerprint": "SHA256:aLGqZo1M6c...",
    "known_hosts": "~/.ssh/known_hosts",
    "working_directory": "/srv/codewhale/work",
    "env_allowlist": ["CODEWHALE_PROFILE"],
    "codewhale_binary": "/usr/local/bin/codewhale"
  },
  "capabilities": ["local", "linux", "tests"],
  "max_concurrent_tasks": 1
}
```

### Alert Channel Secrets

Alert channels (Slack, generic webhook, PagerDuty) use `FleetAlertEndpoint`
instead of raw URLs. The webhook URL can be provided inline for non-sensitive
endpoints, or as a secret reference:

```json
{
  "kind": "slack",
  "webhook": {
    "url_ref": {"key": "CODEWHALE_FLEET_SLACK_WEBHOOK", "source": "env"},
    "secret_ref": {"key": "CODEWHALE_FLEET_SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET", "source": "keyring"}
  }
}
```

The `secret_ref` field provides an optional HMAC secret for webhook payload
signing, never stored in plaintext.

### Config File

The `[fleet]` table in `config.toml` sets global trust policy defaults:

```toml
[fleet]
default_trust_level = "sandbox"
require_identity_verification = true
max_trust_level = "operator"

[fleet.exec]
# Recursion depth shares ONE axis with standalone sub-agents — a fleet worker
# IS a headless sub-agent. 0 blocks child agents (the root worker still runs);
# 3 is the default and the ceiling, affording at least three nested levels.
max_spawn_depth = 3
```

These defaults apply to fleet runs that don't carry their own `security_policy`.
Per-run policies always override the config defaults.

### Capability Grants

Capability grants are additive, scoped permissions that authorize specific
actions. By default, workers get no grants (least privilege). Common grants:

- `"network"` with scope `"github.com"` — allow outbound HTTP to GitHub
- `"git-push"` — allow `git push` to remotes
- `"provider-secrets"` — allow accessing provider API keys
- `"release"` — allow release-related operations (tagging, publishing)
- `"workspace-write"` with scope `"crates/tui/**"` — allow writes within a path

### Environment Sanitization

The host adapter layer enforces environment sanitization at worker start:

- Only `HOME`, `PATH`, and platform-specific vars (`SYSTEMROOT`, `COMSPEC`) are
  injected into worker processes by default
- Environment allowlists reject any key containing `SECRET`, `TOKEN`, `PASSWORD`,
  `PASSWD`, `API_KEY`, `CREDENTIAL`, or `PRIVATE_KEY`
- SSH workers only send explicitly allowlisted variables via OpenSSH `SendEnv`
- Secret values are never embedded in worker argv, task instructions, or fleet
  logs — only secret refs appear, and they are always redacted
