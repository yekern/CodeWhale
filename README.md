## The Idea

Most coding agents start by adding power: more tools, more context, more
autonomy. CodeWhale starts by assigning responsibility.

Before an agent edits a repo, it should have an address: this terminal, this
user, this branch, this session. That is the ego layer. Not swagger; continuity.
Not a persona mask; the place where responsibility attaches.

Then it needs law. A real workspace is a conflict stack: current user intent,
repo instructions, shell output, stale memory, previous handoffs, safety policy,
and half-finished work all compete inside the same turn. CodeWhale gives those
sources an order through the CodeWhale Constitution:

- **Ego is addressable.** The agent is an instance in this terminal and this
  workspace, not a model card or leaderboard score.
- **Evidence outranks narration.** Tool output beats a guess. A failed command
  is reported as a failed command. Verification is part of the task.
- **User intent stays sovereign.** The current request outranks stale repo
  guidance, memory, previous handoffs, and personality overlays.
- **Local law is explicit.** Repositories can add `.codewhale/constitution.json`
  for durable project authority, protected invariants, branch policy, and
  verification rules.
- **Runtime policy is enforced.** Modes, approval gates, sandboxing, rollback,
  and tool schemas are code, not advice the model has to remember.

The product is the ordering layer around the model: who is acting, whose law
applies, what evidence exists, and how the next human or agent can continue.

## What Ships

CodeWhale turns that thesis into plain runtime surfaces:

- approval-gated file, shell, git, web, MCP, RLM, and sub-agent tools;
- side-git snapshots and `/restore` rollback outside your repo's `.git`;
- live diagnostics after edits from language servers where available;
- concurrent sub-agents for parallel investigation and implementation;
- durable sessions, forks, relay handoffs, and runtime APIs for editor/GUI work;
- explicit provider/model routing with DeepSeek V4 first-class and other
  OpenAI-compatible routes kept separate.

DeepSeek is first-class, not exclusive. CodeWhale also carries provider paths for
OpenRouter, NVIDIA NIM, Xiaomi MiMo, Arcee, SiliconFlow, Fireworks, Novita,
OpenAI-compatible gateways, self-hosted SGLang/vLLM, Ollama, and Hugging Face
surfaces as they land.

## Install

```bash
cargo install codewhale-cli --locked
cargo install codewhale-tui --locked
codewhale --version
codewhale --model auto
```

On first launch, CodeWhale prompts for a DeepSeek API key and stores it in
`~/.codewhale/config.toml`; legacy `~/.deepseek/` config is still read for
compatibility.

Other install paths are supported:

```bash
# Platform archives are attached to GitHub Releases.
# https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/releases

# CNB mirror path for users who cannot reliably reach GitHub:
cargo install --git https://cnb.cool/codewhale.net/codewhale --tag v0.8.60 codewhale-cli --locked --force
cargo install --git https://cnb.cool/codewhale.net/codewhale --tag v0.8.60 codewhale-tui --locked --force

# Legacy Homebrew compatibility while the formula is renamed
brew tap Hmbown/deepseek-tui
brew install deepseek-tui
```

The `codewhale` npm wrapper is also available via `npm install -g codewhale`.

For Docker, direct downloads, China mirrors, Windows/Scoop, Nix, checksums, and
troubleshooting, use [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) or the website install
page.

## Upgrading from deepseek-tui

If you installed the legacy `deepseek-tui` package, run the commands for your
install method below. Your existing config, sessions, skills, and MCP settings
are preserved, and DeepSeek provider support is unchanged. See
[docs/REBRAND.md](docs/REBRAND.md) for the full migration guide.

**npm**

```bash
npm uninstall -g deepseek-tui
npm install -g codewhale
```

**Cargo**

```bash
cargo uninstall deepseek-tui-cli 2>/dev/null || true
cargo uninstall deepseek-tui 2>/dev/null || true
cargo install codewhale-cli --locked
cargo install codewhale-tui --locked
```

**Homebrew** - keep using `brew upgrade deepseek-tui` for now; the formula
rename is in progress.

**GitHub Releases** - download the matched `codewhale-*` and
`codewhale-tui-*` archives for your platform from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/releases), then replace the
old binaries on your `PATH`.

After upgrading, run `codewhale doctor` to confirm the migration succeeded.

## First Run

```bash
codewhale auth set --provider deepseek
codewhale auth status
codewhale doctor
codewhale
```

Useful in-session commands:

- `/provider` and `/model` choose the route and model.
- `/config` edits runtime settings.
- `/statusline` shows the current route, cost, and session state.
- `/skills` loads reusable workflows from `~/.codewhale/skills/`.
- `/restore` rolls back a prior turn from side-git snapshots.
- `! cargo test -p codewhale-tui` runs a shell command through the normal
  approval and sandbox path.

## Where Details Live

The README carries the idea and the first path. The details live in docs and on
[codewhale.net](https://codewhale.net/):

- [User guide](docs/GUIDE.md) — first hour with CodeWhale.
- [Install guide](docs/INSTALL.md) — every package path and troubleshooting.
- [Rebrand migration guide](docs/REBRAND.md) — upgrading from the legacy
  `deepseek-tui` package.
- [Configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) — config files, repo constitution, and
  provider settings.
- [Provider registry](docs/PROVIDERS.md) — model routes, credentials, base URLs,
  and capability boundaries.
- [Sub-agents](docs/SUBAGENTS.md) — roles, lifecycle, output contract, and
  recovery behavior.
- [Runtime API](docs/RUNTIME_API.md) — HTTP/SSE, ACP, mobile, and GUI/editor
  integration contracts.
- [Model Lab](docs/MODEL_LAB.md) — open-model discovery and evaluation roadmap.
- [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — crate layout, runtime flow, tool system,
  extension points, and security model.
- [v0.9.0 release acceptance](docs/V0_9_0_RELEASE_ACCEPTANCE.md) — current
  integration checks before release tagging.

## v0.9.0 Track

v0.9.0 is the current integration lane, not a published release until the tag,
GitHub Release, npm package, Cargo crates, and release artifacts are actually
cut and verified.

The release line is gathering work around:

- stronger relay and handoff surfaces;
- calmer transcripts for dense tool runs;
- command and provider architecture cleanup;
- runtime APIs for VS Code and GUI clients;
- typed HarnessProfile posture and model routing;
- WhaleFlow branch/leaf workflow orchestration;
- contributor credit hygiene for harvested and direct community PRs.

Release-specific details belong in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and the v0.9.0
acceptance docs, not in this README.

## Thanks

- **[DeepSeek](https://github.com/deepseek-ai)** — thank you for the models and support that power every turn. 感谢 DeepSeek 提供模型与支持，让每一次交互成为可能。
- **[DataWhale](https://github.com/datawhalechina)** 🐋 — thank you for your support and for welcoming us into the Whale Brother family. 感谢 DataWhale 的支持，并欢迎我们加入“鲸兄弟”大家庭。

This project ships with help from a growing community of contributors. The
maintainer rule is simple: reports and PRs are real project work, even when the
final patch has to be narrowed, delayed, or harvested into a maintainer branch.

For the v0.9 track, harvested PRs should keep visible credit in the commit or
PR body, changelog or release notes, and relevant issue/PR comments. Contributor
credit should use mappable GitHub identities from `.github/AUTHOR_MAP` or
numeric noreply addresses, not placeholder local emails. The contribution gate
is kept in dry-run mode unless a maintainer deliberately enables enforcement;
when it comments, the tone should be warm and practical rather than treating
the reporter as the problem. Recurring contributors should be recognized so the
automation gets out of their way and the public record shows their repeated
help.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Pull requests welcome — check the [open issues](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/issues) for good first contributions.

CodeWhale gets a lot of good reports and PRs. The maintainer posture is to keep
that door open while protecting release quality:

- Issues should stay human-readable and actionable. Intake automation is
  advisory unless a maintainer deliberately enables enforcement.
- PRs are reviewed from code, tests, linked issues, and runtime behavior, not
  from title alone.
- If a PR is too broad to merge directly, maintainers may harvest the safe part
  into a narrower branch, then credit the author and explain what landed.
- Co-author trailers should use mappable GitHub noreply identities from
  `.github/AUTHOR_MAP`; reporters and repro authors should be thanked in
  changelogs, release notes, and closure comments.
- Recurring contributors can be added to `.github/APPROVED_CONTRIBUTORS` so
  dry-run gates stay out of their way.
